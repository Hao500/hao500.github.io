   <p>
    Me and my roomate went to Ikea during the weekend<br>
    I bought some basic household items..<br>
    It's quite challenging for me to assemble furniture myself, even though the instruction they provide is pretty clear, it took me one and half hour to finish assemble a desk, a chair and a little cart :(
